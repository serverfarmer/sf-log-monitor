sf-log-monitor extension is a wrapper for logcheck, logwatch, or other
syslog/systemd-journal monitoring solution, specific to the operating
system distribution and version.

Apart from just installing one of mentioned tools (currently only logcheck
is supported, and only on Debian/Ubuntu), it provides a set of custom rules,
which helps to minimize the amount of messages, that require manual review.
